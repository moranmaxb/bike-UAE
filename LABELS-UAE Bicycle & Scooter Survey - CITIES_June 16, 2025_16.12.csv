I cycle at the Corniche almost every other day—it’s a fantastic experience. Just wanted to share a few safety suggestions:

💦 Sprinklers sometimes wet the cycling track, increasing the risk of slips.

⚠️ E-scooters often go above 20 km/h, which can cause dangerous collisions.

🌫️ During foggy mornings, the track is slippery and visibility is low—some extra lighting would really help.

Appreciate the amazing cycling infrastructure and hope these improvements can make it even safer! 🙏",A proper road and slope connectivity without big jump and have more awareness like ADNOC marathon will encourage people to participate more also if there is some incentive to use cycle for short distance in city to avoide car traffic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Yes

Whether it's a leisurely abra ride across the Dubai Creek or the thrill of a supercar cruise, each journey offers its own slice of adventure.","Dubai has been actively working to promote cycling as a sustainable and healthy mode of transportation. Here are some initiatives that could encourage more people to take up cycling:
Infrastructure Development: Dubai has plans to expand its cycling tracks from 463 km to 668 km by 2025. Dedicated bike lanes and parking slots are being introduced to make cycling safer and more convenient1.
Legislation and Safety Measures: Laws and regulations are being implemented to promote cycling while ensuring safety standards. This includes adopting global best practices for bicycle-friendly infrastructure.
Community Engagement: Events like the ""Cycling is a Lifestyle"" Innovation Lab aim to foster a culture of cycling by involving various stakeholders, including cycling communities, real estate developers, and bike suppliers.
Environmental Goals: Cycling initiatives align with Dubai's Vision 2021 and UAE Energy Strategy 2050, which aim to reduce carbon emissions and promote eco-friendly transportation.
Public Awareness Campaigns: Promoting the benefits of cycling through campaigns and encouraging bike rentals can make cycling more accessible and appealing",,,,,,,,,,,Yes
